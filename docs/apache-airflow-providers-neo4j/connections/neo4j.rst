Neo4j Connection
================
The Neo4j connection type provides connection to a Neo4j database using the `Neo4j Python client
<https://neo4j.com/developer/python/>`_.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------
Host (required)
    The host to connect to.

Schema (optional)
    Specify the schema name to be used in the database.

Login (required)
    Specify the user name to connect.

Password (required)
    Specify the password to connect.

Extra (optional)
    Specify the extra parameters (as json dictionary) that can be used in Neo4j
    connection.

    The following extras are supported:
      * ``encrypted``: Sets encrypted=True/False for GraphDatabase.driver, Set to ``True`` for Neo4j Aura.
      * ``neo4j_scheme``: Specifies the scheme to ``neo4j://``, default is ``bolt://``
      * ``certs_self_signed``: Sets the URI scheme to support self-signed certificates(``neo4j+ssc://``)
      * ``certs_trusted_ca``: Sets the URI scheme to support only trusted CA(``neo4j+s://``)

      Example "extras" field:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
            "encrypted": true,
            "neo4j_scheme": true,
            "certs_self_signed": true,
            "certs_trusted_ca": false
         }

When specifying the connection in environment variable you should specify
it using URI syntax.

Note that all components of the URI should be URL-encoded.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AIRFLOW_CONN_NEO4J_DEFAULT='neo4j://username:password@https%3A%2F%2Fneo4jhost/neo4j-schema?encrypted=true&neo4j_scheme=true&certs_self_signed=true&certs_trusted_ca=false'
