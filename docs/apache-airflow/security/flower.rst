Flower
======

Flower is a web based tool for monitoring and administrating Celery clusters. This topic describes how
to configure Airflow to secure your flower instance.

This is an optional component that is disabled by default in Community deployments and you need to
configure it on your own if you want to use it.

Flower Authentication
---------------------

Basic authentication for Celery Flower is supported.

You can specify the details either as an optional argument in the Flower process launching
command, or as a configuration item in your ``airflow.cfg``. For both cases, please provide
``user:password`` pairs separated by a comma.

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow celery flower --basic-auth=user1:password1,user2:password2

.. code-block:: ini

    [celery]
    flower_basic_auth = user1:password1,user2:password2

Flower URL Prefix
-----------------

Enables deploying Celery Flower on non-root URL

For example to access Flower on http://example.com/flower run it with:

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow celery flower --url-prefix=flower

.. code-block:: ini

  [celery]
  flower_url_prefix = flower


NOTE: The old nginx rewrite is no longer needed
